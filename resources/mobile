The evolution of the mobile space has led to great increase in e-commerce. This is largely due to the fact that it has made instant access to the internet commonplace. This not only gives customers access to businesses, it also gives businesses access to their customers. For large retailers such as Amazon, this leads to savings by not having the cost of maintaining retail stores. These are large costs to the business that would be essential to facilitate customer interactions. Instead companies can have online stores, most of which collect information that would otherwise be near impossible to collect. Purchase history, sizing, and style are a few things they can collect, but some of the more important things would be the things you didn’t buy. Items that you clicked on but didn’t purchase can be a good way to gauge your interests to make suggestions in the future to boost overall sales.  For more traditional businesses there are also many other benefits. From POS systems to inventory management system there are a wide array of mobile devices that are implemented. When making a purchase at most stores there are many processes that are going on in the background. A purchase or return would update the store’s inventory, ensuring that they know what items to stock and when to stock them. But it goes beyond that, it would also help them to be accountable for what the own on taxes and to flag if a particular item was consistently bought or returned. To say the least mobile technology has revolutionized the way that companies do business and will continue to be the most important aspect of their buisness.
