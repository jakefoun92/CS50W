There are many things that an individual or company may need to consider when picking a hosting service. The most important things to consider would be site traffic, reliability, security, and if there is the potential for e-commerce. New emerging companies may try to get by with shared hosting for its simplicity and affordability, however this could potentially lead to issues down the road. In today’s socially connected world, it is not uncommon for new companies to explode in popularity. With something like shared hosting, your customers could be left with slow load times or in a worst case scenario site crashes. Scalability is essential in the day we live, it can either make or break the success of any given company. VPS hosting would be a great starting alternative, providing the extra resources and scalability a larger traffic site might need. On the other side of a coin it allows the company to downgrade to less resources when needed as well. VPS also provides greater security to protect your information, or your client’s information, in the likely event of a digital threat. These benefits come with a higher price tag, however most would still find this hosting fairly affordable. If you want full control the resources on the system your last option would be dedicated server hosting. As the name implies you are given your own server to control traffic, load balancing, custom security, and more. These systems are mostly used by large companies with very high demand and high security risk. They are the most expensive of the three options.
