The paper “Anatomy of a Real E-Commerce System” describes the ecosystem of databases, servers, cod, and networking service that are bundled together for security and scalability to create the systems that we know today. These bundles must contain commerce functions, as well as underlying infrastructure. The commerce functions need to account for user management, for both businesses to business and business to customer relations. Transactions are then regulated under content management; these are typically catalog management. For these transactions you need to know what you are selling to who as well as what information you may or may not be allowed to collect on them. The data that companies collect from customers here are used to upsell their products as well as cross sell to other customers. To support these transactions, you have the underlying infrastructure. These are your databases, security, and web services. This is more or less the backbone of your e-commerce. These systems will make sure you have the inventory that you need and know what is going where to streamline your order fulfillment process. Although these systems seem complex they have led to much better results and a streamlined customer experience.
